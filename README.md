# bad-nanny
This private repository documents my research and simulations around securing nanny cams and IoT devices in the home. As a parent and aspiring cybersecurity professional, this project bridges my personal safety concerns with technical learning goals in network security, IoT, and CompTIA A+ exam preparation.

## Goals
- Simulate reconnaissance and exploitation techniques using safe, ethical platforms (e.g., TryHackMe)
- Harden a test network and analyze vulnerabilities in low-cost nanny cam devices
- Build foundational skills in IoT security, VLAN configuration, and incident detection

## Tools & Platforms
- TryHackMe (SmartCam, Smart Home, IoT 101)
- VirtualBox / VM for sandboxed experiments
- Wireshark, Nmap, Shodan

## Note
All research and testing is done in sandboxed environments and does not target or interact with real devices outside my control.
