# ☁️ Cloud vs Local Monitoring in IoT Devices: A Personal and Security-Critical Reflection

## 🤔 Why This Matters

As I began exploring how to secure my nanny cams, I thought the biggest risks were on the device level—default passwords, firmware exploits, exposed ports. But the deeper I go, the more I realize:

> Modern attacks aren’t just about breaking into the device.  
> They’re about compromising the **ecosystem around it**—especially the cloud.

## 🔍 The Core Insight

When a nanny cam relies on a mobile app that connects to a cloud service, you’re not just interfacing with the camera. You’re interfacing with:
- Cloud storage servers (where footage is kept)
- Authentication services (login credentials)
- Web APIs (used by the app to send and receive commands)
- Update servers (delivering new firmware)
- Analytics infrastructure (telemetry, usage stats, etc.)

So even if your home network is secure…  
Even if your camera is isolated on a guest VLAN…  
You’re still trusting **a remote architecture you don’t control**.

## 🛠️ Attack Vectors That Now Matter

| Layer | Potential Vulnerability |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Cloud Storage | Misconfigured permissions, exposed video buckets |
| App API | Weak auth, token reuse, insecure endpoints |
| User Accounts | Credential stuffing, weak passwords reused from breaches |
| Traffic Flow | Unencrypted connections, expired certs, bad TLS setups |
| Update Path | Supply chain attacks, poisoned firmware |
| Analytics | Metadata leakage, facial recognition without consent |

## 🧠 Realization That Hit Me

While talking to my professor, I realized I had a moment where I was like:
> "I'm over here trying to hack into my own cams… but I didn't even fully understand how **monitoring worked**, let alone how cloud access changes the threat model."

It was funny—but also deeply enlightening.

## 💸 The Money Layer

Most cloud access comes at a price:
- Premium plans for cloud recording
- Subscriptions for remote access
- Lock-in to vendor ecosystems

Which means **privacy now has a subscription fee**, and if you opt out?  
You’re forced to manually manage local-only setups with fewer features and more friction.

## 💡 Ideas I'm Exploring

- Keeping my cams on a guest network ✅
- Using a **dedicated device** (e.g., old phone or tablet) for monitoring ✅
- Considering setting up my own **local NVR solution** or self-hosted software like Blue Iris or MotionEye
- Learning how to inspect API traffic using tools like Burp Suite or Wireshark to better understand the app-to-cloud relationship

## 🧩 Final Thought

> “Security isn't just about firewalls and passwords. It’s about *asking who owns the infrastructure* behind your peace of mind.”

This repo started as a curiosity about nanny cam security.  
It’s now becoming a deeper exploration of **how much control we give up**—and how to take it back.
