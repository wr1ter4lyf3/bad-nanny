🌐 The Two Paths of IoT Attacks: Local vs Remote
🔒 Local (Inside one's own Wi-Fi)
What I tried today: 
You're already on the network, so you can see 192.xxx.xx.x IPs

A hacker would need:

To crack my Wi-Fi password

Or trick someone into joining a compromised guest network

Or infect a trusted device inside my LAN (e.g., phishing, rogue app)

There was a practice CompTIA A+ question that addressed security concerns around IoT devices.
The correct answer suggested keeping the device's firmware updated and establishing the connections on guest LANs (logical segregation, I think)

🚨 Remote Hacking (Over the Internet)

Question: Can an attacker reach my private IP from the internet directly?

❌ Not unless my router is misconfigured or intentionally forwarding traffic (i.e., port forwarding or UPnP).

So how do they do it? 👇

🧪 Real Remote IoT Attack Chain
1. Shodan Recon or Search
Attackers use Shodan.io or Censys to scan the internet for:

Devices with open ports (80, 554, 23, 443, etc.)

Known strings in banners like:
“WebCamXP”
“VStarcam”
“IPCam Web Interface”

They’re looking for cams that are:

Exposing their interface directly to the web

Using default credentials

Or running vulnerable firmware from past CVEs

2. Try to Connect via Public IP
If my ISP IP is, say, 8.37.42.101, and your router is forwarding port 554 to your cam:

rtsp://8.37.42.101:554/live
Boom—video stream.

Or:
http://8.37.42.101:8080
→ Access to your camera’s login page.

3. Login or Exploit
Use known default creds (they're often published in manuals)

Brute-force with tools like hydra or medusa

Exploit known CVEs (like a buffer overflow or unauthenticated command execution)

🔐 So How Do You Stay Safe?
✅ Check for these:
UPnP disabled on your router (auto-port-forwarding = 🔥🔥🔥)

No manual port forwarding to your cameras

Your cams are not visible on Shodan (I can show you how to check)

Strong Wi-Fi credentials (WPA2/WPA3)

Segmented network or VLAN for IoT

🔍 Want to test your public exposure?
You can:

Visit: https://www.shodan.io

In the search bar, try:

netcam
port:554
country:"US"
Or search your public IP (you can find it at https://whatismyipaddress.com)

If nothing comes up—GOOD. That means you're not broadcasting your devices to the world.

Some kind of meraki router cam up when I searched on Shodan.io. I was curious but didn't really dive into it. 

There's a difference between hacking remotely and then actual hardware hacking, which usually requires a toolkit ranging from $5-$100 depending on what you're trying to do.
I watched some of a defcon presentation on it--was really interesting. But yeah, we're trying to do this without any potential shock damage or bricking objects

Going back to local hacking, here were the commands used: 

nmap 
sudo apt update (apt is Advanced Package Tool that allows for managing software packages on Debian and Debian-based Linux distros)
sudo apt install nmap -y (Linux kindly let me know that I needed to install it lol)   
nmap -sn (Ping - finds active hosts)
nmap -p (Port Scan- checks specific ports) 
nmap -p- (Scans all 65k+ ports as a Full port scan) 
nmap -sV (Version detection)
nmap -O (OS detection)
nmap -A (Aggro scan)

Then I got eye fatigue from looking at all the scans and decided to pause for here lol that's enough 
Oh those letters after the dashes are flags or options (sometimes switches depending on the context) 
I know I'm gonna review this one day and go "uh...no dip!" but hey, we all started somewhere lol for me it was hacking my own nanny cam. 
nmap is pretty common so I'm glad I got to use this one more today. No successful hacking of the nanny cam (yet!)
