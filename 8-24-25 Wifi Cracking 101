🗝️ My First Crack: Wi-Fi Hacking 101

Today I completed the Wi-Fi Hacking 101 lab on TryHackMe, and it was my first end-to-end wireless engagement.

🔄 What I Did

Set up my Kali VM and fought with shared folders until I won.

Extracted a .tar.gz into .cap files.

Used aircrack-ng to successfully crack my first Wi-Fi password.

Learned how to convert .cap → .hccapx for Hashcat, and understood how it scales for real-world cracking.

🔑 What I Learned

Workflow matters more than flags. Capture → convert → crack.

Aircrack is the “training wheels,” Hashcat is the “power tool.”

Cracking is offline: once you have the handshake, no network/internet required.

Weak passwords are still the #1 entry point. My old password Japanese1 would’ve been toast in seconds — and it reminded me why attackers thrive on human patterns.

⚡ Reflections

This was more than just typing commands. It was the moment where labs started feeling like muscle memory instead of random syntax.
That “KEY FOUND!” moment made me realize: I can totally see myself doing this for real.

✅ Next Step: Try the same workflow on my own hotspot capture.
